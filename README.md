# WeiDai: A stablecoin that only grows in value
## backed by MakerDAO's Dai ERC20 stablecoin
	* WeiDai is issued and redeemed at an exchange rate determined by the reserve(Dai)/totalSupply(WeiDai)
	* In addition to being a regular ERC20 token, WeiDai can be burnt. Whenever it is, the denominator of the exchange equation (above) declines, pushing up the price of WeiDai. This is the chief mechanism through which WeiDai gains value relative to Dai. Consider the following illustrative example:
	Suppose there are 100 WeiDai in circulation and 100 Dai in reserve. The exchange rate is 1. Nimrod owns 20 and Sarah owns 80. Nimrod decides to burn them all because he's crazy. The exchange rate is now 100/80 = 1.25. Previously, Sarah could exchange her WeiDai for 80 Dai. Now she can exchange them for 100 Dai. Her WeiDai has grown in value because Nimrod burnt his.
	* When WeiDai is redeemed for Dai, a percentage is burnt, implying that regular redemption gradually pushes up the price.
	* The price cannot be pushed down through dumping since the token is 100% collateralized by DAI. Only DAI price instability can introduce instability into WeiDai
	* WeiDai is produced by mining *PATIENCE*: In order to produce WeiDai, holders of Dai must send their Dai to a special contract known as the Patience Regulation Engine. Their new WeiDai is immediately produced at the current exchange rate but is held in reserve. The owner is advised to wait a certain number of blocks before claiming their new WeiDai. If they claim their holding prematurely, they incur a penalty tax which starts at 100% and declines linearly until the waiting period is over. The proceeds from this *impatience tax* is burnt, pushing up the redeem price of the remaining WeiDai in the system. The impatience duration is akin to a mining difficulty and adjusts dynamically according to how easy or hard users find it to wait out the duration.
	* There are no need for external oracles or centralized control of any kind. Everything happens in smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Price feeds are *outsourced* to the Dai ecosystem. This means that WeiDai is only as reliable as Dai.

## Vision
By creating a token that cannot fall relative to the US dollar but which will necessarily grow, it is hoped that WeiDai will provide a risk-free, inflation beating method of saving that allows HODLers to free themselves of having to research financial or crypto markets. 

In time, it is hoped that marginalized, underbanked and unbanked communities around the world will be able to safely insulate themselves from inflation both in the short, medium and long term. By creating a new era of **thriftcoins** which rewards saving disproportionately, the cultural damage caused by central banking credit expansion which has given rise to an ambient norm of consumerism will be gradually reversed and replaced by a thrifty culture of self-reliance and monetary frugality. In turn, communities will be able to self capitalize, enabling both charity and business finance to naturally decentralize.
