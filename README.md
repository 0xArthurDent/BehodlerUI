# UPDAI: A stablecoin that only grows in value
## backed by MakerDAO's Dai ERC20 stablecoin
	* Updai is issued and redeemed at an exchange rate determined by the totalSupply(Updai)/reserve(Dai)
	* When Updai is redeemed for Dai, 9% is burnt, reducing the denominator of the above equation, increasing the price => churn pushes up the price
	* The price cannot be pushed down through dumping since the token is 100% collateralized by DAI. Only DAI price instability can introduce instability into DAI
	* Regular "burn games" reward speculators who compete for a prize. On aggregate, more Updai is burnt than handed out as rewards, increasing the issue/redeem price automatically. Burn games are not games of chance and are designed to be resistant to cheating Ethereum miners.

## Vision
By creating a token that cannot fall relative to the US dollar but which will necessarily grow relative to the US dollar, it is hoped that Updai will provide a risk-free, inflation beating method of saving that allows HODLers to free themselves of having to research financial markets. 

In time, it is hoped that marginalized, underbanked and unbanked communities around the world will be able to safely insulate themselves from inflation both in the short, medium and long term. By creating a new era of growth coins which rewards saving disproportionately, the cultural damage caused by central banking which has given rise to an ambient norm of consumerism will be gradually reversed and replaced by a thrifty culture of self-reliance and monetary frugality. In turn, communities will self capitalize, enabling charity, caring and business finance to naturally decentralize.
