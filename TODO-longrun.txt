TODO long run: 
	1. replace public with external where possible: external is only for functions that won't be called by methods. parameters by reference --DONE
	2. dai global settlement
		-same as upgrade
	3. Write an integration article for https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides
	4. Upgrade from single to multi (let's hope they launch before I do): 
			https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides/tree/master/mcd
			"If there are smart contracts with the address of Dai hard-coded, update the address to the address for MCD which will be published at launch"
			Versioning complete
			Ownership DAO:
				=> when default changes, current stakers keep existing votes but receive no more (date of change recorded)
				=> 100 votes per day per weidai
				=> propsals in ring queue. items can only be added to queue when it expires.
				=> stake 10 votes to make a proposal.
				=> address cannot make more than 1 proposal at a time
				=> votes are not transferrable.
				=> when a proposal has expired, it can be removed from queue by activating it. Releases staked votes to caller
				=> proposals of 3 types can be makerdao
				=> require 75% majority(or most votes in queue or something)

	5. Front end versioning:
		- disable buying functionality entirely
		- drop down or some sort of selector to switch version
