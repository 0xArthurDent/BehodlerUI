design front end:
	- think about drizzle 
	--types: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html


Steps: 
1. design layout component with props only
2. create a store.ts for the state of the page
3. write actions, constants etc for the page
4. Read drizzle example and create a drizzle provider, first without ts
5. If not using ts is too cumbersome, look into creating types using above url
   Else get away without types on the index page 
6. figure out how to load basic blockchain info using drizzle sagas etc.
7. If 6 can be done without an ethereumAPI then remove into
8. introduce routing on the central content section. 
9. Have only one container since the dapp is ideally small
