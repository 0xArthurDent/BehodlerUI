Interactions with metmask post 2020: -- DONE
This article explains how to create an updatable context (no need to use redux) https://dev.to/oieduardorabelo/react-hooks-how-to-create-and-update-contextprovider-1f68

1. implement front end transfer to new reserve
2. Write a ReserveContract that just wraps chai and stores it.
3. ^do this after behodler. With fast enough growth, it might be worthwhile to unplug from DSR altogether.

1. On page load, top level calls ethereumAPI.detectMetaMaskEnabled() and gets 1 of 2 values["disabled","disconnected"]
2. set the context value. 
3. Subscribe to eth_accounts with a closure to setcontext as per https://gist.github.com/rekmarks/d318677c8fc89e5f7a2f526e00a0768a
4. Button in header for connect/getmetamask. Always says connect wallet with popup of install/connect
4. Use context to set visibility of infopanel and optionally hide some actions (pre,redeem etc)

transaction of pot reserve: 0x9366133eff7ea1bb80d3e6d5c684814f4926db095da82d6c7baac55931827b3f
