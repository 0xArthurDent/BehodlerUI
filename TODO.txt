For next time:
read context https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html
look at use reducer with context to allow deep dispatching without passing props all the way down (this is going to make my code so much neater)


Re-write and replace redux with hooks

Front end:
1. bug when clicking on edit friendly after metamask signed in: pencil click action resets metamask state
1. Metamask: create components for not enabled and not connected that layout frame shows
2. wire up all the other layout sections
3. routing and pages...
