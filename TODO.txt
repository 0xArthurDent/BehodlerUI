NO WINDOWS!
Steps:
	1. abandon drizzle for now (npm uninstall)
	2. create actions, reducers etc for updating everything in wallet. --DONE
		-> implement redux with no sagas. --DONE (although sagas are possible)
	3. Have the site load with no info --DONE
	4. Create a loading saga that "fetches" each info thing from a mock service just to get it all to work --BUSY
	 	--> mapState To Props -- DONE
		--> wire up friendly stuff on component
		--> think about the blockchain link, saga etc
	5. remove wallet container --DONE
	6. create an EthereumAPI that only sagas invoke (define module for trufflecontract)
	7. Either implement the EthereumAPI using best practices or see if you can squeeze drizzle in.
	8. Now we can do routing
