16. In set Dependencies,
	1. show all contract groups with addresses.
	2. allow contract groups to be added or edited
	3. Set active contract group.
	4. Have a Choose version button in the actions.
	5. Only show this navigation button if there are more than 1 versions.
	6. When a user chooses a non active version, then PRE must just display a message saying weidai isn't active for this version.
	

Governance:
No beta period. Give owner the ability to shut down indefinitely. At some point this power can be handed over to a true DAO but as long as Maker is dodgy and Ethereum is fickle, I have to keep it centralized.
