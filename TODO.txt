Shift donation fee deduction from Pre and Bank to WeiDai -- DONE
Question: should reserve put funds in DSR?
If so, 
	This is the savings pot:
	https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/master/src/pot.sol

	To get balance, call pie.
	To deposit, call join
	To withdraw call exit.

So Redeem rate won't call dai.balanceOf but pot.pie[self]
