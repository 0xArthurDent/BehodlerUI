	8. Popup can only close if !disabledUI
	9. Important notice: MakerDAO periodically releases new versions of Dai, setting the old versions to inactive. Since WeiDai wraps Dai, new versions of WeiDai are released in step with Dai and old versions are disabled. You have positive balances of old weiDai <and are currently using an inactive version of weidai>. For your safety, you may only redeem your balances of old WeiDai for old Dai. MakerDAO provides instructions for how to redeem old Dai for collateral.  

	For full functionality of WediDai, you will need to upgrade your version of WeiDai.
	<upgrade now>

	foreach balance of oldWeiDai
	version: 1     balance: 100      <enable weidai>/<redeem>
  

Governance:
No beta period. Give owner the ability to shut down indefinitely. At some point this power can be handed over to a true DAO but as long as Maker is dodgy and Ethereum is fickle, I have to keep it centralized.
