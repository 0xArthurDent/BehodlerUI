18. have a drop down in set dependencies to allow you to change current version. Dependencies will now only ever show one set of contract group.
    You set your active and it refreshes everything. window.reload. --BUSY
	18.1 Implement add group which brings a popup of
		all the addresses, the name, version number (autofilled) -- string to bytes16 bug
19. Upgrade old versions
	19.1 At page load, loop through versions and inspect user's weidai balance foreach. 
	19.2 If balance exists on non default version, bring popup that says "You have WeiDai balances from prior versions of WeiDai. Then labels below with 
			WeiDai version 2: Xdai 
			Balance: 2000
			Dai value: 1245
			<Redeem />
	19.3 Dialog can be closed if active version for user is default version.
	19.4 Your active version of WeiDai is out of date. For your safety, functionality on the dapp is disabled until you upgrade your active version.
	19.5 Why am I seeing this? Slide down explaining that MakerDAO releases new versions occasionally.

Ongoing FAQ:
Talk about difficulty adjustments, how often etc.
Other coins can be burnt

Governance:
No beta period. Give owner the ability to shut down indefinitely. At some point this power can be handed over to a true DAO but as long as Maker is dodgy and Ethereum is fickle, I have to keep it centralized.
