For next time:
- pass all tests again
- new tests for versioning
- beta period of 1 year: (don't compromise. Don't be arrested. win win win: I think that means no alterations, just shut down)
	- max 50 dai can be spent per session
	- new weidai creation can be shut down permanently and irreversibly 
- implement and test Fallback functions

Front end:
1. Metamask: create components for not enabled and not connected that layout frame shows
2. wire up all the other layout sections
3. routing and pages...
